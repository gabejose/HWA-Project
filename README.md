# HWA-Project

This project is a basic web application that simulates an inventory system that holds the details of rowing clubs in the UK and the different kinds of boats these rowing clubs have (ranging from small boats such as singles (1x) and doubles(2x)/pairs(2-) to bigger boats such as coxless fours (4-) and eights (8+)). This also includes the different companies that make these boats, such as Empacher, Filippi Boats and Hudson Boat Works.

## Coding style

Before each method, add a comment using // and briefly describe what the method does, specify what the parameter(s) and return type(s) is (if applicable). This is to ensure that for shared projects, the other person can understand what each method does and makes debugging easier.

```
// Comment saying what the method does
// @param if the method has any parameters
// @return if the method has a return type (not needed if return
// type is void)
public <return type> <method name>() {
    <code goes here>
}
```
